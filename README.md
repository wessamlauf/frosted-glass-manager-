### Customize your Frosted Glass experience without touching a single line of YAML. 🛠️

**Frosted Glass Theme Manager** is a powerful companion integration for Home Assistant. It allows you to easily customize the popular Frosted Glass aesthetic directly from the UI. Change colors, switch backgrounds, and generate optimized theme files instantly.

## ✨ Features

- **UI Color Picker**: Change the **Primary Color** for both Light and Dark modes using a visual picker. No more editing code! 🎨
- **Smart Tonal Palette**: This isn't just a simple color swap. The manager mathematically calculates a complete **Material Design tonal palette** (shades 05–95) based on your chosen color. This ensures text remains readable and contrast stays perfect. 🧠
- **Custom Backgrounds**: Easily paste a URL for your custom background images. 🖼️
- **Dual Generation**: With a single click, the manager generates two themes:
    1.  **Frosted Glass Custom**: The full experience with blur and glass effects. ❄️
    2.  **Frosted Glass Custom Lite**: A performance-optimized version for older devices (no blur). ⚡
- **Instant Updates**: Changes are applied immediately without needing to restart Home Assistant. 🚀
